# I Quit

The Company can't fire you if you quit first!
Activate the eject sequence yourself and start over.

## What does this mod do?

This mod adds a new `iquit` command in the ship terminal.
When used, the ship will start the eject sequence that is normally launched when you are fired by the Company.
Everybody deserves a fresh start. :)
