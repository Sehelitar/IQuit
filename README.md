# I Quit

*The Company can't fire you if you quit first!*<br/>
**Bypass the eject sequence and start over immediately!**

## What does this mod do?

This mod adds a new `iquit` command in the ship terminal.
When used, the mod will instantaneously reset your game and give you a brand new ship!
You can also choose the "normal" way and start the eject sequence that is normally launched when you are fired by
the Company (check the configuration).

Everybody deserves a fresh start. :)

**Note** : If you do that while in orbit, this mod will make the ship go back in orbit before doing the reset.
